# gg_json

ChatGPT The `gg_json` package is a versatile tool designed for ease of use when
working with JSON files, allowing users to effortlessly write or read values.

By simply providing a path formatted as `a/b/c/value`, the package automatically
structures the data into a nested JSON format:

```json
{
  "a": { "b": { "c": "value" } }
}
```

This intuitive path-based approach streamlines the process of manipulating JSON
data, making it accessible for both reading and writing operations. Users can
navigate through the nested structure with ease, enabling efficient data
retrieval or modification with minimal code, enhancing productivity and reducing
complexity in handling JSON files.
